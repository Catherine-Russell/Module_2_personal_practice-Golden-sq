diary_contents = "I am still in shock. Today has been one of the most overwhelming days of my life! Today was the day I learnt we are going to be moving to England. As I sit here, looking out over Kingston, my heart is beating a million miles an hour in anticipation as questions race through my mind: what will England be like? Will it be like Jamaica? Where will we live? Will we be able to find work? It all began when my husband arrived back in Jamaica having been discharged from the British Royal Air Force. He has served for two years and had been based in Oxford, which he described as a quaint, picturesque city. For the last two months, he has been rambling on about moving the whole family to England – he is SO enthusiastic, he will hardly chat about anything else! This morning he woke up particularly early seeing as he doesn’t have a job and rushed down to Kingston Harbour where there was a meeting for ex-service people. While he was there, I cooked ackee and saltfish for the kids before I sent them off to their primary school.Throughout my shift in the hospital, I felt uneasy and when I returned home I was met with the news… He has bought tickets for us all to travel on a massive boat, which is departing from Kingston to England! As he told me the news, his eyes sparkled and his face was flushed with colour – he was, it seemed, ridiculously excited. When the children returned from school, we told them the news and we were met with screams of joy and what seemed like a million questions. I am excited too, but apprehensive about leaving my friends, my work and my sister. I suppose I’ll just put on a brave face for them even though I’m not sure how I feel! Sitting here now, three words are etched into my mind – ‘the Empire Windrush’. The words mean nothing to me, but represent the future, a new life and hopefully new life and hopefully better opportunities for us. Despite my stomach still churning, I must go to bed now as tomorrow I need to start go to bed now as tomorrow I need to start go to bed now as tomorrow I need to start go to bed now as tomorrow.
